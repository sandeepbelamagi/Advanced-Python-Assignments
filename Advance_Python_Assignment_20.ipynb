    "###### Q1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes&#39; benefits and drawbacks.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the **float** and **decimal** types store numerical values in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **floats** when convenience and speed matter. A float gives you an approximation of the number you declare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **decimals** when precision matters. **Decimals** can suffer from their own precision issues, but generally, decimals are more precise than floats. The performance difference between float and decimal, with Python 3, is not outlandish, and in my experience, the precision benefits of a decimal outweigh the performance benefits of a float."

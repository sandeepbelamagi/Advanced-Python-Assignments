    "###### Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are useful in search and replace operations. The typical use case is to look for a sub-string that matches a pattern and replace it with something else. Most APIs using regular expressions allow you to reference capture groups from the search pattern in the replacement string."

    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "Both **(ab)c+** and **a(bc)+** are valid patterns. The difference between both these patterns is that in **(ab)c+ ab** is a group whereas in **a(bc)+ bc** is a group. Capturing groups are a way to treat multiple characters as a single unit. They are created by placing the characters to be grouped inside a set of parentheses."

    "The Characters .,*,?,^,or,(), have a special signiface when used with square brackets. They need not be be explicitly escaped by \\ as in case of pattern texts in a raw string. Range in Regular Expressions Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a ‘-‘, for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59."

    "There is a difference between the use of both functions. Both return the first match of a substring found in the string, but re.match() searches only from the beginning of the string and return match object if found. But if a match of substring is found somewhere in the middle of the string, it returns none.\n",

When one wants to match a literal backslash, it must be escaped in the regular expression. With raw string notation, this means $r\"\\\"$. Without raw string notation, one must use 4 times back slashes"

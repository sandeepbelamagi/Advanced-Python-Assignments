    "##### Q1. What is the purpose of Python&#39;s OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. The object is related to real-word entities such as book, house, pencil, etc. The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code. It is a widespread technique to solve the problem by creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major principles of object-oriented programming system are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Class\n",
    "    * Object\n",
    "    * Method\n",
    "    * Inheritance\n",
    "    * Polymorphism\n",
    "    * Data Abstraction\n",
    "    * Encapsulation\n",
    "    \n",
    "Some Advantages are mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making problem solving easy through the use of objects\n",
    "    * Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
    "    * Multiple instances of an object can be made and explored."

    "##### Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "__Ans :__ Python searches for an attribute in an upward tree of attributes. Tt first searches for the attribute in its instance and then looks in the class it is generated from, to all super classes listed in its class header"

    "__Ans:__ The differences between a class object and an instance object are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "    2. Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for a class this doesnot happens.\n",
    "    3. A Class is created once. Many objects are created using a class.\n",
    "    4. As Classes have no allocated memory. they can't be manipulated. but objects can be manipulated."

    "    * Instance Methods (object level methods)\n",
    "    * Class Methods (class level methods)\n",
    "    * Static Methods (general utility methods)\n",

    "##### Q5. What is the purpose of the init method?\n",
    "**Ans:** __init__ is a reseved method in python classes. It serves the role of a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class"

    "##### Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To create a class instance, we need to call the class by its name and pass the arguments to the class, which its init method accepts.\n",
    "\n",
